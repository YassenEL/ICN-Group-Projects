//Description of the approaches to construct the topology


In our code, we used a program that combined both the traceroute and the graph into one, so that when it is run a map of the topology is constructed with Node which represent the IP addresses from the traceroute to multiple IP addresses. There are then the edges
constructed to show the path between the IP addresses within the Howard Network, and each IP address represents a new router or network device in Howard's public wifi.
