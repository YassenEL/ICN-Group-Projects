//Presentation of the milestones (programs developed, topology fragment discovered) and the associated date/time. For each program developed, provide the finish date/time and the responsible team member(s).
//For each topology fragment discovered, show the screenshots of the program output, draw the diagram of the topology fragment, and provide the name and Howard ID of the team member making the discovery. 
//Each Topology fragment  can only be attributed to one team member


Just uploaded a version of the code that I think is complete. Our next steps now are to go around campus and run this traceroute at different buildings, and next we'll need to develop a program to be able to read the output
and produce a topology map from it. Once that program is completed, I believe we will be close to completing this project.
