//Presentation of the milestones (programs developed, topology fragment discovered) and the associated date/time. For each program developed, provide the finish date/time and the responsible team member(s).
//For each topology fragment discovered, show the screenshots of the program output, draw the diagram of the topology fragment, and provide the name and Howard ID of the team member making the discovery. 
//Each Topology fragment  can only be attributed to one team member


Instead of showing the screenshots and the diagram, since the program output was very large due to having to go through thousands of IP addresses, we have provided the directory within the github or the file if downloaded to see that specific topology fragment and the program output as well.
